FusionDirectory Life Cycle
==========================

A maintained version is a **major** version for which we release **minor** bug fix releases and communicate about security vulnerabilities.

Our general support policy is to maintain major releases until **3 months** after the next major version is released to give some time for upgrading.
 
We also provide a more conservative life-cycle through **ESR** versions.
 
The **ESR** tag is given to a major release once it has been thoroughly tested and proven reliable on real production systems. 

**ESR** versions are maintained until **6 months** after the next **ESR** version is announced, allowing less frequent major upgrades, 
and a larger time-frame for switching between them.
